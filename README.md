# Weather Dashboard 

I have coded this application to pull back basic weather information from openweathermap.org. The user will be prompted to enter a city name, and upon being entered a 5 day forecast will be shown for the location. Previous searches will be shown and stored locally for ease of use.

Please click <a href="https://snowslurpie.github.io/weather-dashboard/" target="_blank"> here </a> to view the deployed project.
